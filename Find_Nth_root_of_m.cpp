/**

You are given 2 numbers (N , M); the task is to find NâˆšM (Nth root of M).

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated integers N and M.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, print an integer denoting Nth root of M if the root is an integer else print -1.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 200
2 <= N <= 20
1 <= M <= 109+5

Example:
Input:
2
2 9
3 9
Output:
3
